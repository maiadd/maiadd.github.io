## Introduction

Hello! My name is Maia Darmon, and I am entering U3 in Honours Mathematics at McGill University.<br>
I am currently exploring different areas of math such as logic, model theory, as well as theoretical computer science, and I am also interested in learning more about group theory, representation theory and Galois theory.
I am taking a minor in linguistics as well, and I would be really excited to learn about fields which combine this with math and computer science.</p>


## Projects

* NSERC Research Project with Pengfei Guan on curve shortening flows and isoperimetric inequalities (Summer 2019)
* Honours Research Project with Marcin Sabok on Hilbert's <i>Entscheidungsproblem</i> using GÃ¶del's incompleteness theorem and computability theory (Summer 2020)
